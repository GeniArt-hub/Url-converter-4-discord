Many platforms like **X (Twitter), Instagram, TikTok, Threads, or Bluesky** generate links that don’t embed properly on Discord. URL Converter fixes that in one click (or with a keyboard shortcut) by transforming the current tab’s URL into an alternative format that previews correctly.

### Key features

* **One-click conversion**: Click the extension icon or use a keyboard shortcut to convert and copy the URL of the active tab.
* **Keyboard shortcut support**: Fully integrated with Chrome’s shortcut system.

* **Built-in presets** for popular platforms:
  * X (Twitter)
  * Instagram
  * TikTok
  * Threads
  * Bluesky
* **Customizable rules**: Define your own conversion rules using simple source URLs (no regex required).
  
* **Discord-optimized output** for better embeds and previews.
* **FR / EN interface** with instant language switching.
* **Clean & modern UI**, designed to stay simple and efficient.
* **Privacy-friendly**: no tracking, no analytics, no data collection.

### How it works

1. Open a supported social media link.
2. Click the URL Converter icon (or use the shortcut).
3. The converted URL is copied to your clipboard.
4. Paste it into Discord and enjoy proper embeds.

### Why use URL Converter?

* No need to manually edit links.
* Works across multiple platforms.
* Fully customizable for advanced users.
* Fast, reliable, and unobtrusive.

URL Converter is ideal for content creators, community managers, moderators, or anyone who regularly shares social media links on Discord.
